> A rookie's goal is to **master the fundamentals of programming** and to **understand the importance of libraries and frameworks**

- Learn how to use and work with tests
- "_live and breath unit test"_
- Moment.js, Jackson, Lodash, Apache Commons
- Understand the difference between Libraries and Frameworks
- Hand rolled functionality --> Libraries --> Frameworks
- shouldn't focus on tools

> The main goal of an exercise is **not to entertain**. It should be created around a particular technique and should help the students understand that technique
>
> **Motivation is good but not at the expense of content. Programming is not easy. If the students don't have an intrinsic motivation, coding might not be the way to go.**

- Many business applications center around complex forms and grids. Creating these is an important skill.

###### Functional Programming

Advantages over **Object-Oriented Programming**:

- Avoiding state
- mutability
- side-effects
- more robust and less fragile applications

###### Declarative vs. Imperative

> Any relational language or functional language. These kinds of programming languages describe **relationships between variables in terms of functions or inference rules**, and the language executor (_interpreter or compiler_) **applies some fixed algorithm to these relations to produce a result.**

> Declarative languages contrast with imperative languages which **specify explicit manipulation of the computer's internal state**; or procedural languages which specify an explicit sequence of steps to follow.

> Imperative programming is about telling your machine **how** to do something

> Declarative programming is about telling your machine **what** you would like to happen in order to do something

Consider the following:

**Problem Statement:**

> we have a **sequence of values** for which we wish to **aggregate** the result of **performing an operation (function) on each element in the sequence**

```javascript sumOfSquares.js
/* imperative implementation */
function sumOfSquares(nums) {
  var i,
    sum = 0,
    squares = []
  /* perform operation on each element in sequence*/
  for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    squares.push(nums[i] * nums[i])
  }
  /* aggregate the results */
  for (i = 0; i < squares.length; i++) {
    sum += squares[i]
  }
  return sum
}
```

```clojure
/* declarative implementation */
(defn squares-of [n]
    (* n n))

(defn sum-of-squares [nums]
    (reduce + (map #(squares-of %) nums)))

(sum-of-squares '(1 2 3 4 5))
```

```javascript
/* declarative */
function sumOfSquares2(nums) {
  return (
    nums
      /* perform operation on each element */
      .map(function (num) {
        return num * num
      })
      /* aggregate the results */
      .reduce(function (start, num) {
        return start + num
      }, 0)
  )
}
```

> ...we switch from thinking about for loops and indices to **processing sequences or streams of input values** (_think Unix style pipes_):
>
> - Use the built-in capabilities of the sequence to **map** the desired operation on each element
> - Use the built-in capabilities of the resulting sequence to **reduce** (aggregate => _reduce_ a set of values into a single value) its elements to our desired value

###### Ideation: Objectives and Outcomes

- expected features
- survey the market to look at similar ideas to enable you to **differentiate** ones project
- while drawing inspiration
- **Clearly express the central idea of project**
- **Identify the problem being addressed**
- **Delineate a set of features that you expect your website and app should support**
- **Identify other projects with similar features that may act as exemplars**

**Blocking**: Occupying the resources of the _thread_ and if the application logic will need to be focused on that task at the expense of anything else it might be doing at the time

## Notable Bot Types

- Machine Learning

- Markov Chain

> A stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event

- Corpus Fed

> In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). They are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory

- Generative Image Bots

- _Just Plain ~ Weird ~_

### Decorator Pattern

> While both **Interfaces & Abstract Classes** can not be instantiated, an interface can not have implementation details where as an abstract class can
